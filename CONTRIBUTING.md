Open a pull request if you would like to propose improvements.
* Document, but don't over-comment.
  * While I'm not exactly following Sphinx, code documented in a similar style will be greatly appreciated.
* Emphasise readability over optimisation.
* Use only standard modules, preferably those which are part of the CPython implementation.
* Please be nice.
