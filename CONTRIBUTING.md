# Contributing Guidelines
Open a pull request if you would like to propose improvements.
* Document, but don't over-comment.
  * While I'm not exactly following Sphinx, docstrings in a similar style will be greatly appreciated.
* Emphasise readability over optimisation.
  * But don't go overboard! Rule of thumb: write Pythonic code.
* Use only standard modules, preferably those which are distributed with the CPython implementation.
* Please be nice.
